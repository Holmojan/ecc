error correcting codes

=============================================================================
basically use a variant of sreed-solomon code

just copycat the similar function in winrar  

=============================================================================
it run over the finite field GF(257) and GF(65537)

257 and 65537, as known as the fermat number, can use fft transform for 
fast calculation

also, this two numbers, with a little modify, can fit byte and word perfect

=============================================================================
compile need c++11(at least gcc4.8 or vs2015)

=============================================================================
in fact, my english is so badly, I am hardly to tell any more...
